### Credits
This rust app was adapted from Anish's work in [courses-backend] (https://github.com/ScottyLabs/courses-backend).

The files have been modified to not connect to database.

### How to run
cd into the rust directory, then run `cargo run -p datafetcher` in the terminal. This will output a file called all_courses.json.
